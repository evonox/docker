# Velocity-Animate Extracted Code

As we need to decrease the bundle size of the Docking Library, I have extracted some parts
of code originating from the Velocity Animate JS animation library.

Most of the extracted code is a part of pre-computing the easing functions using Bezier curves.

Original code can be found at URL: https://github.com/julianshapiro/velocity/
